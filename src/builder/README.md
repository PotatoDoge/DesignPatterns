# Builder
## Definition:
The Builder Pattern is designed to provide a flexible solution to various object creation problems in object-oriented programming. It is used to construct a complex object step by step, separating the construction process from its representation.
## When to Use:
- When you need to create an object with multiple optional parameters.
- When you want to avoid the telescoping constructor anti-pattern.
- When you want to construct different representations of the same object.

## Examples
- When constructing an object with many parameters, some of which are optional, the Builder pattern simplifies object creation by allowing the client to specify only the desired attributes, avoiding constructor overloads and providing a clear and readable construction process.
- When creating immutable objects (objects that cannot be changed after they're created), the Builder pattern provides a way to set all necessary properties during object creation. This is particularly useful for objects that have many properties and require complex validation or preparation steps.
- For objects that represent configurations (e.g., settings for a software component), the Builder pattern allows for flexible and incremental construction, ensuring that all required configurations are set before the object is used.
- In scenarios where object construction involves multiple steps or configurations, the Builder pattern improves code readability and maintainability by clearly separating the construction process from the representation. This makes the code easier to understand and modify.
- In testing scenarios, the Builder pattern can be used to create test objects with different configurations, facilitating the creation of various test cases without the need for numerous constructor overloads.
