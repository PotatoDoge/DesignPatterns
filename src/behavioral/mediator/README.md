# Mediator
## Definition:
The Mediator Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. It promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly and allows for easier maintenance of the system. The mediator acts as a central hub through which all communication between objects passes.
## When to Use:
- When you have a complex set of interactions between objects that needs to be managed and simplified.
- When you want to reduce the dependencies between communicating objects.
- When you need to centralize control of communication between objects to make the system easier to maintain and extend.

## Examples
- In a chat application, a chat room acts as a mediator between users. Users send messages to the chat room, which then distributes the messages to all other users in the room.
- In an air traffic control system, the air traffic controller (mediator) manages communication between different aircraft and ensures safe separation between them.
- In a complex form with multiple fields that depend on each other, a mediator can handle the interaction between fields. For example, changing the value of one field might affect the options available in another field.
- In a home automation system, a central controller (mediator) manages communication between various devices (e.g., lights, thermostats, alarms). When a user interacts with one device, the mediator coordinates the response with other devices.
