# Chain of Responsibility Pattern

## Definition:
The Chain of Responsibility Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to pass a request along a chain of potential handlers until one of them handles the request. This pattern decouples the sender of a request from its receivers and allows multiple objects to process the request in a chain-like manner.

## When to Use:
- When you have multiple objects that can handle a request, and you want to pass the request along a chain until one of the objects handles it.
- When the processing of a request should be done by one or more objects in a sequence.
- When you want to avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver.

## Examples:
- In an application that handles logging messages with different severity levels (e.g., info, warning, error), you can create a chain of handlers where each handler processes messages of a specific severity level. Messages are passed along the chain until they are handled.
- In a user authentication system, different authentication checks (e.g., username/password validation, two-factor authentication) can be handled by different objects in a chain. Each object processes a part of the authentication process.
- In a support ticket system, tickets can be passed along a chain of support representatives with varying levels of expertise. Each representative can handle tickets based on their expertise level until the ticket is resolved.
