# State Pattern
## Definition:
The State Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class. The pattern enables an object to change its behavior based on its state without using complex conditionals or state-specific code.
## When to Use:
- When an objectâ€™s behavior depends on its state, and it needs to change behavior at runtime based on that state.
- When the state-specific behavior is scattered across different methods or classes.
- When you want to avoid large conditional statements and encapsulate state-specific behavior in separate classes.

## Examples
- In a media player application, the behavior of the player (e.g., play, pause, stop) changes depending on its state (e.g., playing, paused, stopped). Each state can be encapsulated in separate classes, simplifying state transitions and behavior.
- In an order processing system, the state of an order (e.g., pending, processed, shipped, delivered) determines the actions that can be performed. Each state can have different handling logic encapsulated in separate classes.
- In a workflow management system, different stages of a workflow (e.g., draft, review, approval, completed) can be represented as states. Each stage defines specific actions and transitions to the next stage.
