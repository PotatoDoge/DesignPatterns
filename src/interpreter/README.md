# Interpreter Pattern

## Definition:
The Interpreter Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides a way to evaluate language grammar or expressions. This pattern defines a grammar for a language and provides an interpreter to interpret sentences in the language. It is used to build an interpreter for a language or expression grammar.

## When to Use:
- When you have a language or expression grammar that you need to interpret or parse.
- When you need to define a grammar for a language and provide an interpreter for it.
- When you want to simplify the parsing and interpretation of expressions or commands.

## Examples:
- In a mathematical expression evaluator, you can use the Interpreter Pattern to define grammar rules for mathematical expressions and interpret or evaluate these expressions.
- In a query language for databases, you can use the Interpreter Pattern to parse and interpret queries based on a predefined grammar.
- In a simple scripting language, you can use the Interpreter Pattern to define the language syntax and interpret commands or scripts written in that language.
