# Visitor Pattern

## Definition:
The Visitor Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to define new operations on elements of an object structure without changing the elements themselves. It separates algorithms from the objects on which they operate, enabling you to add new operations without modifying the objects' classes.

## When to Use:
- When you need to perform operations on a set of objects with different types without modifying their classes.
- When you want to define a new operation without changing the classes of the objects it operates on.
- When you need to separate an algorithm from the object structure it operates on.

## Examples:
- In a graphic design application, you can use the Visitor Pattern to perform different operations (e.g., drawing, resizing) on various graphic elements (e.g., circles, rectangles) without modifying the graphic element classes.
- In a document processing system, you can use the Visitor Pattern to apply different formatting or analysis operations (e.g., word count, syntax highlighting) on different types of document elements (e.g., paragraphs, images).
- In a shopping cart system, you can use the Visitor Pattern to apply different discount strategies (e.g., seasonal discounts, loyalty discounts) to various items in the cart without changing the item classes.
