# Abstract Factory Pattern

## Definition:
The Abstract Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It allows clients to create objects that belong to a particular family of products, without knowing the exact class of the objects that will be created.

## When to Use:
- When you need to create multiple families of related objects, and you want to ensure that the objects are compatible with each other.
- When you want to provide a way to create objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- When the client code needs to work with different families of objects interchangeably.

## Examples:
- In a user interface toolkit, you can use the Abstract Factory Pattern to create different types of UI components (e.g., buttons, scrollbars) for different operating systems (e.g., Windows, macOS). Each factory produces components that are consistent with the appearance and behavior of the target OS.
- In a game development scenario, you can use the Abstract Factory Pattern to create different types of game objects (e.g., enemies, weapons) based on the game genre (e.g., fantasy, sci-fi). Each factory produces objects that fit the theme of the genre.
- In a furniture store, you can use the Abstract Factory Pattern to create different styles of furniture (e.g., modern, traditional). Each factory produces furniture items (e.g., chairs, tables) that match a specific style.
