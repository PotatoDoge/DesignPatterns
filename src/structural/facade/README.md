# Facade Pattern

## Definition:
The Facade Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. It involves creating a single class that wraps and simplifies the interactions with a set of classes or a complex system, providing a higher-level interface to make it easier for clients to use.

## When to Use:
- When you need to provide a simple and unified interface to a complex subsystem or set of classes.
- When you want to reduce the complexity of interactions with a subsystem by providing a single point of access.
- When you want to decouple the client code from the complexity of the underlying system or library.

## Examples:
- In a home theater system, you can use the Facade Pattern to create a simple interface for controlling various components like the DVD player, projector, and sound system. The facade simplifies the process of turning on the home theater and setting it up for a movie.
- In a software application with multiple modules (e.g., user management, billing, reporting), you can use the Facade Pattern to provide a single interface for interacting with these modules, making it easier for the application to manage and coordinate these operations.
- In a library management system, you can use the Facade Pattern to provide a simple interface for common operations like borrowing and returning books, which might involve interacting with complex internal systems.
