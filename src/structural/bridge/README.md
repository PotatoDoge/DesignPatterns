# Bridge Pattern

## Definition:
The Bridge Pattern is a structural design pattern that separates an abstraction from its implementation, allowing the two to vary independently. It involves creating a bridge interface that delegates the work to an implementation object, making it easier to switch or extend implementations without affecting the abstraction.

## When to Use:
- When you want to avoid a permanent binding between an abstraction and its implementation.
- When you need to switch or extend the implementation of an abstraction at runtime or compile-time.
- When you want to provide a way to handle multiple variations of an abstraction without altering the client code.

## Examples:
- In a graphics system, you can use the Bridge Pattern to separate the abstraction of drawing shapes (e.g., circles, rectangles) from their implementation (e.g., drawing on a canvas or a window). This allows you to change or extend the drawing method without affecting the shape abstraction.
- In a remote control system, you can use the Bridge Pattern to separate the abstraction of control commands (e.g., power, volume) from their implementation (e.g., controlling a TV, radio). This allows you to support different types of devices with the same set of commands.
- In a database application, you can use the Bridge Pattern to separate the abstraction of database operations (e.g., querying, updating) from their implementation (e.g., SQL, NoSQL). This allows you to switch between different types of databases without changing the core functionality.
