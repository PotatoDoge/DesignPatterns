# Design Patterns Overview

Design patterns are solutions to common problems in software design. They provide templates for how to solve issues and build systems in a scalable and maintainable way. Design patterns are categorized into three main types: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral. Below is an overview of each type.

## 1. Creational Patterns

Creational patterns focus on the process of object creation. They abstract the instantiation process and make it more flexible, allowing systems to be independent of how their objects are created, composed, and represented. 

### Key Patterns:
- **Singleton**: Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
- **Factory Method**: Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.
- **Abstract Factory**: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- **Builder**: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.
- **Prototype**: Creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype.

## 2. Structural Patterns

Structural patterns deal with object composition, creating relationships between objects to form larger structures while keeping them flexible and efficient.

### Key Patterns:
- **Adapter**: Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together by converting the interface of a class into another interface expected by the clients.
- **Bridge**: Separates an abstraction from its implementation, allowing the two to vary independently.
- **Composite**: Allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies, making clients treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.
- **Decorator**: Adds new functionalities to objects dynamically without altering their structure.
- **Facade**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier to use.
- **Flyweight**: Reduces the cost of creating and manipulating a large number of similar objects by sharing common parts.

## 3. Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral patterns focus on communication between objects, what goes on between objects and how they operate together to achieve specific behaviors.

### Key Patterns:
- **Chain of Responsibility**: Passes a request along a chain of handlers, allowing multiple objects to handle the request without the sender needing to know which object will handle it.
- **Command**: Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing you to parameterize clients with queues, requests, and operations.
- **Interpreter**: Defines a grammar for a language and provides an interpreter to interpret sentences in the language.
- **Iterator**: Provides a way to access elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
- **Mediator**: Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact, promoting loose coupling by preventing objects from referring to each other explicitly.
- **Memento**: Captures and externalizes an object's internal state without violating encapsulation, allowing the object to be restored to that state later.
- **Observer**: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
- **State**: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes, appearing to change its class.
- **Strategy**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each algorithm, and makes them interchangeable, allowing the algorithm to vary independently from the clients that use it.
- **Template Method**: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses.
- **Visitor**: Defines a new operation to a set of objects without changing their classes.

## Conclusion

Design patterns provide time-tested solutions to common problems in software design. Understanding and applying these patterns helps in creating flexible, reusable, and maintainable code. This overview of Creational, Structural, and Behavioral patterns should provide a solid foundation for using design patterns effectively in your projects.
